# Official Microsoft Landing Page Clone

## DISCLAIMER:

The reason for this project is Solely for educational purposes, the links don't go anywhere and this page is in no way affliated with the Official Microsoft Website. Click [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ng/) to visit their official website for all official purposes.

## Overview

This is an attempted clone of Microsoft Official Website, there are still clear distinctions between this project and the official website such as my intentional use of Font Awesome and omission of outlines around the Navigation links. The Search Bar does not work.

The page is fully responsive, containing several media queries which makes it veiwable across multiple devices.

## Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- VanillaJS
- Desktop-First workflow
